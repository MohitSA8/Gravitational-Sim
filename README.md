# Gravitational-Sim
Gravitaion Simulator code in c++ to calculate basic orbitals of objects with custom mass and initial velocity..
This is a basic 3d gravitational simulator
You can either input custom values for the initial positions of the objects, and their velocities in the x, y, z axis, or create random values for all of the variables.

The output of the code is a txt file with the data that can be used to graph a 3d graph.
Future plans are to upgrade the code to have real time rendered graph, add or remove objects at random during the simulation, and lastly add a live collision system.
